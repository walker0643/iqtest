### OVERVIEW

Let's find out how many everyday users have no idea how to use their keyboards to perform simple tasks... like dismissing a message box.

*Note:* If a user is **not** using Windows then (s)he is probably pretty comfortable with a keyboard. Therefore this project targets winapi exclusively.

### REQUIREMENTS

- Windows 7 or later
- msys2
- make tools
- g++

### BUILDING

1. pull to local dir
2. open your msys2 shell
3. "make" for debug or "make release" if you want the stripped version
